# 🎮 Vibe Code Game Club

Welcome to the **Vibe Code Game Club** — a creative coding space where we learn the fundamentals of web development by **building small interactive games** with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Our goal is to understand how visual design, animation, and logic blend together to create experiences that *feel alive* — what we call **vibe coding**.

## 💡 What Is “Vibe Coding”?

**Vibe coding** is about writing code that feels expressive and intentional.  
Instead of focusing only on functionality, we experiment with:
- **Color, rhythm, and motion** — how visuals respond to user actions  
- **Sound and feedback** — how interactions *feel*  
- **Layout and flow** — how users move through an experience  

By combining simple web technologies, we can shape how users *perceive and feel* a site or game.

## 🧠 Why Make Games to Learn Web Design?

Games are perfect mini-projects for web developers:
1. **HTML** teaches structure — the canvas, elements, and game layout.  
2. **CSS** handles styling and animation — colors, motion, and vibe.  
3. **JavaScript** brings logic and interactivity — collisions, scoring, events.

Each game project helps you practice the same skills you’ll use in modern website design:
- Interactive buttons, hover effects, and transitions  
- DOM manipulation for dynamic pages  
- Responsive design and visual flow  
- Experimentation with timing, easing, and smooth motion

## 🧩 Starter Project: `bubbles.html`

Our first project is **Bubble Pop**, a lighthearted game where you move an element and pop bubbles for points.  
It’s designed to:
- Introduce the core HTML structure for a simple canvas
- Practice CSS positioning and animation
- Write JavaScript functions for movement and collision detection

You can open it directly in your browser or in **GitHub Codespaces**.
